When modifying or creating Python code, follow these guidelines:
1. Extract complex logic into separate, well-named functions
2. Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
3. Add descriptive docstrings to all functions explaining parameters and return values
4. Use meaningful variable names that reflect their purpose
5. Group related functions into separate modules or classes when appropriate
6. Add error handling for edge cases
